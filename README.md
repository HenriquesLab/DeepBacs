# DeepBugs
Deep-learning assisted bioimage analysis in microbiology using open-source technology

DeepBugs demonstrates the potential of open-source deep-learning approaches in microbiological research.
We provide dataset that can be used to train models for different tasks, e.g. image segmentation, denoising, artificial labeling or prediction of super-resolution images.

In our opinion, the lack of meaningful examples and accessible image data prevents microbiologists to explore deep learning and thus experience its potential.
We want to change this! DeepBugs does not provide novel code, but uses popular DL networks implemented in the [ZeroCostDL4Mic platform](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/ZeroCostDL4Mic/wiki).

The learning approaches employed in DeepBugs were pioneered by many great scientists
