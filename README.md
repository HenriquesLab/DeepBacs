# DeepBacs
## Deep-learning assisted bioimage analysis in microbiology using open-source technology

DeepBacs demonstrates the potential of open-source deep-learning approaches in microbiological research.
We provide dataset that can be used to train models for different tasks, e.g. image segmentation, denoising, artificial labeling or prediction of super-resolution images.

In our opinion, the **lack of meaningful examples and accessible image data** prevents microbiologists to explore deep learning and thus experience its potential.

DeepBacs does not provide novel code, but uses popular DL networks implemented in the [ZeroCostDL4Mic platform](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/ZeroCostDL4Mic/wiki).
It provides easy access to DL networks in a streamlined format and, together with suitable data, enables scientists to deep into the DL universe rapidly and without hardware acquistion. 

**_List of tasks with links to the respective Wiki pages:_**

* [Segmentation](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/DeepBugs/wiki/Segmentation)
* [Object detection](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/DeepBugs/wiki/Object-Detection)
* [Denoising](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/DeepBugs/wiki/Denoising)
* [Artificial labeling](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/DeepBugs/wiki/Artificial-Labeling)
* [Prediction of super-resolution images](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/DeepBugs/wiki/Super-resolution-prediction)


**The learning approaches employed in DeepBacs are based on the work of many deep learning pioneers.**

Further details about that can be found on the [ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/ZeroCostDL4Mic/wiki) and our [DeepBacs wiki](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/DeepBacs/wiki).
